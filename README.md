Scala JSON DSL

- lightweight
- typesafe
- strict
- concise

Motivation
----------
There is a need to have JSON in Scala code when writing tests for REST services.

Main motivation is to have similar to original JSON syntax inside Scala code as a type safe alternative to having raw text as a JSON. This approach lets avoid generating incorrect raw JSON and simplify embedding values in resulting JSON.
